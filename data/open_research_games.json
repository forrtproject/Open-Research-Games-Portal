An Open Science Cupid is selected who decides upon the best fit, and the player who played that card earns one point. The role of Cupid then passes on the next player to their left. The game can be played in two variations, one in which the cupid selects the best fit and provides their rationale for their choice, and one in which the players first articulate an argument of why their card presents the best fit.",

For instance, if researchers struggle to answer questions about metadata, this may indicate a need for additional training on that topic.", "A downside of the format is that it can only be played with small groups around one board.

This way, we don’t lose too much time explaining how to play, and it allows researchers to borrow the game and play it on their own without a member of the research support team present.", "And we have also experienced that the game works well both as an introduction to key concepts (which could be followed by a more in-depth training session), and the other way around: you can first give a training and then end with the game as a way to see how much they understood and repeat some information.

This paper investigates constructivist and experiential strategies for effective learning and deep understanding of postgraduate research skills and proposes a game-based learning (GBL) solution. A (non-digital) game called How to Fail Your Research Degree was designed and iteratively developed. Gameplay loop analysis identifies various learning and game mechanics and contextualises them in relation to GBL theory. Evaluation of gameplay (n = 127) demonstrates effective transmission of intended learning outcomes and positive game experience based on Keller’s Attention-Relevance-Confidence-Satisfaction (ARCS) model. Discussion proposes that the game has high cognitive authenticity, relies heavily on tutor facilitation, can create tension between knowledge and confidence, and is applicable to multiple domains and learning situations. GBL is proposed to be an original and effective approach to teaching high-level, functional learning outcomes such as academic research skills."],
