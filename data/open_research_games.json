For instance, if researchers struggle to answer questions about metadata, this may indicate a need for additional training on that topic.", "A downside of the format is that it can only be played with small groups around one board.

This way, the game can still be used for bigger groups.", "The game concept is intentionally straightforward to ensure the rules are easy to understand. This way, we don’t lose too much time explaining how to play, and it allows researchers to borrow the game and play it on their own without a member of the research support team present.", "And we have also experienced that the game works well both as an introduction to key concepts (which could be followed by a more in-depth training session), and the other way around: you can first give a training and then end with the game as a way to see how much they understood and repeat some information. This not only helps participants repeat a bit what they have learned, but also new topics can be discussed that didn’t come up during the training."],
